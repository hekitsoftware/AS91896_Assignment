Change Log (from Testing):
-------------------------------------

- Fixed input validation for box dimensions
Issue: Program accepted values outside the client-given 5–100 cm range.
Fix: Added a GetValidDimension() method to handle validation.

- Fixed input validation for phone numbers
Issue: Program accepted any input as a number (including letters/symbols)
Fix: Added GetValidPhoneNumber() function; Now requires 7–11 digits for input.

- Improved island selection
Issue: Chunky confusing way of finding island in array
Fix: Used a LINQ method for matching; (Also converted user input to uppercase for consistancy)

- Corrected receipt formatting
Issue: Costs displayed without 2 decimal places.
Fix: Used formatting (F2) for standard price-format output.

- Added GST calculation
Issue: Didn't calculate a total with GST
Fix: Total now shows both subtotal and total with GST in the receipt for clarity.

- User experience refinements
Issue: Various issues that made the terminal hard to read
Fix: See Below >>>
	- Added header dashes for styling
	- Added clear screen between steps to maintain focus on the current question
	- Added checkpoints to make sure the input info is correct for the user information
	- Added option to calculate another item without restarting program.
